Notes:
 - This project was developed in part by using the tool GitHub Copilot Business.
 - This program seems to be functioning as intended, but has had very limited testing. It is still considered experimental at this stage, so don't be surprised if it doesn't work correctly. You should vet the code before using it! For me, this project was about getting practice using AI-based tools, and generating example code which may aid me in the development of future projects.
